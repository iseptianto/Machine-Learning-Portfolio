## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use
Each project includes **data preprocessing, model training, and deployment** steps. To run them locally:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-link>
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python app.py  # Flask applications
   ```
4. Access the UI via:
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:5000/
   ```

## üåü Future Improvements
- Expand models with **Deep Learning techniques**.
- Integrate **real-time data updates** for forecasting.
- Build an interactive **dashboard with Streamlit**.
